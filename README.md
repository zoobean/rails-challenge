## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in joining our team! We're excited by the idea of working with you.

## Application

The goal of this repository is to provide you with a very simple Rails application so you won't need to run `rails new app_name` and worry about the foundation of things.

## Goals

We're not expecting to see a complete solution the challenge given to you. Instead, we want to observe your style while you're working to solve the given problem.

This is an opportunity for you to show us how [how quality-driven you are]

Here's a few things that we'll be looking for as you work through your solution:

- Great, consistent communication
- Simple, clean code. Quality over quanitity.
- Efficient, scalable code
- High-quality test scenarios
- Not afraid of making mistakes
- Solid grasp of technical tradeoffs
- Ability to collaborate technical information with the rest of the team
- Small, meaningful commits

While a full solution is not expected, working components that meet some of the requirements are.

## Add-ons

We encourage you to use any libraries or gems that help you achieve your goal.

## Technical Challenge

You'll be given further instructions during your technical interview.
