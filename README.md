## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in joining our team! We're excited by the idea of working with you.

This is the starting point for the Zoobean Rails live-coding interview. We created this repository to provide you with a very simple Rails application so you won't need to run `rails new app_name`.

## Interview Preparation

Before the interview, please complete the following steps:

```
1. clone this repo locally
2. run `bundle install` successfully
3. run `rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed` to create the sqlite database
```

Once those steps are completed, please ensure everything is working by running `rails s` and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see a table of books that looks similar to the image below.

## Sample User Account

**Email:** example@example.xyz
**Password:** something

## Goals

During the interview, we're not expecting to see a complete solution. Instead, we want to observe your style while you work to solve the given problem.

Here are a few things that we'll be looking for as you work through your solution:

- Great, consistent communication
- Simple, clean code that's efficient. Quality over quanitity.
- Tested code
- Small, meaningful commits
- Not afraid of making mistakes
- Solid grasp of technical tradeoffs
  
While a full solution is not expected, working components that meet some of the requirements are. You are encouraged to ask any and all questions or for clarification. 

## Add-ons

We encourage you to use any libraries or gems that help you achieve your goal.

## Technical Challenge

You'll be given further instructions during your technical interview.

## Submission

In some scenarios, we may ask you to continue working through your technical challenge after the interview has ended. In those cases, please do not submit pull requests to this repository. Instead, share your work in a Zip file.
