## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in joining our team! We're excited by the idea of working with you.

This is the starting point for the Zoobean Rails live-coding interview. We created this repository to provide you with a very simple Rails application so you won't need to run `rails new app_name`.

Before the interview, please prepare your setup by having:

* cloned this repo locally
* having run `bundle install`` successfully
* having run `rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed` to create the sqlite database

Once those steps are completed, please ensure everything is working by running `rails s` and navigate to http://localhost:3000. On this page, a table of books should be displayed.

## Goals

We're not expecting to see a complete solution the challenge given to you. Instead, we want to observe your style while you're working to solve the given problem.

Here are a few things that we'll be looking for as you work through your solution:

- Great, consistent communication
- Simple, clean code. Quality over quanitity.
- Efficient, scalable code
- High-quality test scenarios
- Not afraid of making mistakes
- Solid grasp of technical tradeoffs
- Ability to collaborate technical information with the rest of the team
- Small, meaningful commits

While a full solution is not expected, working components that meet some of the requirements are.

## Add-ons

We encourage you to use any libraries or gems that help you achieve your goal.

## Technical Challenge

You'll be given further instructions during your technical interview.

## Submission

- Fork this repository to your own git
- After you fork the repo, you can then run the following commands in your terminal:

``````
bundle install
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
rake test
``````

- Do not submit pull requests to the main repository. Instead, share your repository in a Zip file.
- Feel free to modify existing specs, if necessary
